# temperature-converter

#The user will input a temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and press a "convert" button. The converted temperature will then be displayed with the correct unit.

#Your UI should include four main elements:

#Input field for the user to type in their temperature - don't forget to validate that the input is a number!
#Dropdown menu or radio button for the user to choose if they are inputting in Celsius or Fahrenheit
#"Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion
#Display area for the final converted temperature and unit
